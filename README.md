## Ear Training TODOs

- For note selectors: add an element to play them 

- Show how long the currently configured exercise is going to take / will still take

- New version of the stepped melody with more interesting rhythm options and variable length (at most 3 beats)

- Stepped melody hangs out for too long at the top note of the range

- Start stepped melody at a known note (e.g. start of range or the lowest root)
