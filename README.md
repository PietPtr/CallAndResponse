## Ear Training TODOs

- Set a key and a range of notes through a new range field (or two fields), e.g. `E1-B2`

- For note selectors: add an element to play them 

- Configurable rest between figures (instead of a dropdown for zero and 1 measure)

- Show how long the currently configured exercise is going to take / will still take
